                    <h3> "Angel" -- Gorgeous rare mahogany bay tobiano 5-1/2 year old Tennessee Walking Horse mare, bred, raised and trained right here on our farm. (We also raised both her parents!) Angel loves people and pretty much comes in from the pasture, puts her head in the halter to be led back to the barn. She has been camping at the lake, as well as the ocean and also to Falling Waters in Arkansas for a week. Angel has never known any kind of abuse or neglect, and consequently she is very trusting. She has had one foal, a beautiful black minimal tobiano colt that is also for sale. We believe Angel is homozygous for tobiano gene, as both her parents were spotted and her first foal is spotted, even though the sire is solid. This can be confirmed with a $40 DNA test. Angel has a beautiful racking gait that floats across the ground, but her canter is really spectacular, automatic and easy. She floats up into the easiest rocking chair canter and understands her lead commands. Angel also sidepasses, pivots, forehand turns, backs, loads easily, stands tied for hours, and probably most riders would feel pretty comfortable on her. She is registered with TWHBEA, current on her vaccinations, worming and negative coggins. $6850 Click on her photo to see videos and photos.

                    JW" -- Beautifully marked, head full of sense, big boned, wide chest, big rump, one nice Tennessee Walking Horse colt! He is Jackpot's 'uncle', born out of Jackpot's granddam, Kitty. This is going to be one sane, gentle, family-type horse that will be rugged enough for the biggest man, and gentle enough for the youngsters in the family. His markings are so flashy and beautiful, and I particularly love his big bone structure. He will have a beautiful smooth gait with a slow, rocking chair canter. JW already knows how to pick up his feet for hoof cleaning, load in a trailer, walk over obstacles on the obstacle course, be ponied by another horse, be ponied by a 4-wheeler, stand tied while tractors haul round bales by and move dirt, and he has had several baths in his life. He has grown up with cattle, goats, a pig, other horses in a natural environment, crossing creeks and traveling through muddy areas at will. I have hauled him to the vet when I take other horses, just to give him the experience. He is weaned and ready for his new home, and his price includes TWHBEA registration, vaccinations, and negative coggins. $2500.

                before you meet the horse. Weanlings and yearlings Tennessee Walkers have been imprinted at birth,

                trailer.&nbsp; If you desire, we can arrange for a vet check on the horse you 
                are interested in, and for out-of-state buyers, you can check to see what your
                state requires for shipping a horse (from anywhere) into your state, as well as
